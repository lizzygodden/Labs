    Winston Schmidt
</h2>
<p>Winston Schmidt, or 'Schmidt', is known in the show New Girl as being the hilarious "top-dog" of the apartment. He does all of the cooking and cleaning, and loves his suits neatly pressed and his sweaters to be cashmere. He works at an all-women's marketing firm (except for him of course). </p>
