<h2>
    Nick Miller
</h2>
<p>Nick Miller is by far my favorite character on New Girl. Throughout the entirety of the show, he never fails to make everyone laugh with his strange, disorganized personality and because of the fact that he never seems to know what is going on. Nick is down to do anything and lives a very laid back lifestyle, as he partly owns a bar with Schmidt that he manages. </p>
